# OA-F25
OhioAnts Founding chamber based on easily available 25mmx75mm microscope slides is an opensource project designed for keeping and founding new ant colonies. The OA-F25 has been designed with input from dozens of ant-keepers as the ultimate founding chamber for newly collected queens. 

## Details
The most unique features include a chamber with four distinct humidity and temperature zones. From the front to the backâ€¦

- Cool/Dry
- Cool/Humid
- Warm/Humid*
- Warm/Dry*

These temperatures zones, when combined with a standard reptile heating cable and the OA-F dock provide a temperature and humidity gradient that allows the queen and her nanitics to decide which best fits their growth and development phases.

The front and rear ports accept standard, 1/2 O.D. vinyl tubing to connect to other housing structures or outworlds. additionally, these ports can be filled with cotton.

A humidity port is also included on the front of each founding chamber, this allows a 18-20GA needle to be inserted to fill the hydration area without the need to remove the glass cover to prevent stressing out the inhabitants, or unnecessary escape attempts.

## Printing
Print at .2mm height and 25-30% infill. The 25mm x 75mm glass microscope slides may not fit if printed at a thicker layer.

Both PLA and PETG are great for this formicarium. The provided images and examples are using light gray PETG available here (https://amzn.to/3dBMde2)
